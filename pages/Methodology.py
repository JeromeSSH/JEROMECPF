        ### Steps to Generate Projections
        1. **Gather Current Account Balances**:
           - Users input their current CPF account balances to enhance accuracy.
       
        2. **Define Projection Parameters**:
           - Users specify current wages, expected increments, and contribution periods. This includes monthly wage input to ensure clarity in projections.
       
        3. **Calculate Contributions**:
           - Utilizing CPF contribution rates based on the user's age group, calculate expected contributions over time.
       
        4. **Estimate Growth Based on Rates**:
           - Apply the latest interest rates for Ordinary, Special, and MediSave Accounts to forecast growth, incorporating compound interest for more accurate projections.
       
        5. **Generate Projections Report**:
           - Create a report detailing projected balances, key insights, and whether users are on track to meet various CPF milestones (Basic Retirement Sum, Full Retirement Sum).
       
        6. **Display Insights**:
           - Present vital information, such as housing affordability estimates based on Ordinary Account accumulation, and when users might hit various CPF milestones.
